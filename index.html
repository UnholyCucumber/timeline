					<br><u><b>BUS 461U</b></u>: <b>Competitive Case Analysis & Presentation B (WLU)</b>; January was the actual JDCC competition in Guelph; Laurier only came second but it was overall still a great experience; I learned how to be a more effective

					Very productive term; I learned a great deal about investing as well as how to be a more effective person.

					<br><font size="6">Cambridge Global Asset Management</font> <br>
					This work term was amazing; I worked as a <b>Research Analyst</b> analyzing equities ranging from European furniture retailers to global tobacco companies. I had excellent mentors who showed me the ropes of investing, from using 
					Bloomberg and FactSet, to building three-statement models and interviewing company directors. I gained a great deal of insight on how an investor views a business or an industry; this work term really opened the floodgates on my interest
					 in business and investing. My greatest takeaway was not only the financial/investing knowledge, but the Cambridge mentality, to be humble, to abhor complacency and to be conscientious of one's own work and responsibilities. I also picked up 
					reading again; I had always loved books growing up so it felt like a reunion to read regularly again. I also learned about networking and the importance of
					 having a professional network; I finally broke out of my shell of comfort and started attending networking events.
					
					This was a very fun work term, and I learned a great deal about investing and research, but I have yet to scratch the surface of the knowledge about markets and equities; there is still much to learn.

					<br><u><b>CS 241</b></u>: <b>Foundations of Sequential Programming (UW)</b>; this course was plenty of work, but I learned a great deal about compilers and putting all of that knowledge together in the end 
					to build a mini-compiler was pretty cool
					<br><u><b>CS 251</b></u>: <b>Computer Organization and Design (UW)</b>; I have always been clueless about computer hardware and this course shed some light on how hardware and software work together in computers
				    	<br><u><b>BUS 352</b></u>: <b>Introduction to Marketing (WLU)</b>; I learned about the different aspects of marketing; the course dealt with marketing theory, such as product/market fit and customer segmentation
					<br><u><b>BUS 354</b></u>: <b>Human Resources Management (WLU)</b>; having dealt with many recruiters, it was very insightful to see what was on the other side of the equation
					<br><u><b>BUS 393</b></u>: <b>Financial Management II (WLU)</b>; I really enjoyed the course; I learned a great deal about the cornerstones of financial theory, such as the Modigliani-Miller Theorem
					<br><u><b>BUS 461U</b></u>: <b>Competitive Case Analysis & Presentation A (WLU)</b>; this was the course associated with Laurier JDCC
				<br><br>
					I felt that I grew a great deal during this semester; I definitely felt that I was able to allocate my time and energy more effectively and as a result, I was able to be more productive and more impactful (especially
				 	with my extracurriculars). I also started taking courses on Excel and financial modelling, and reading investing books such as <i>Poor Charlie's Almanack</i> and <i>The Intelligent Investor</i> to prepare for my upcoming
					co-op work term.

					and organizations around campus to work together to modify and approve budgets. I also worked with other council members to screen and approve new club applications and help out with events such 
					as Club Day; it was very good to get more involved on campus with extracurriculars not necessarily associated with my program.

					I volunteered as an instructor for the EC 120 (Introduction to Microeconomics) course. It was pretty interesting to be on the other side of the podium; I definitely sympathize much more with profs who have to
					talk for hours without break. Economics was always something that interested me so it was fun teaching it to first-year BBA and Economics students; I learned many tricks to be a better teacher, including 
					finding relatable examples and connecting with students on a personal level. With a partner, I held 4 exam review sessions, with over 600 students attending, and raising over $12,000 towards charity.

					I decided to be a mentor for first year double degree students; I personally had an extremely difficult time adjusting and succeeding during my first year in university, so I thought it would be a great if my experiences
					 and insights from my own (disastrous) first year can deliver value to others who are about to go into double degree. It was great hanging out and chatting with first-year students and helping them avoid some of the pitfalls 
					which I experienced during my first year in university.

					<br><u><b>CS 245</b></u>: <b>Logic and Computation (UW)</b>; I love logic, so this course was one of my favourite courses taken in university thus far; this course teaches propositional and

				    <br><u><b>MATH 239</b></u>: <b>Introduction to Combinatorics (UW)</b>; I really enjoyed the problem-solving nature of the course, particularly graph theory

					I was also responsible for many important projects, such as performing analysis on multi-million dollar promotions, and presenting, as well as discussing, the findings with both the VP, and the client.
					Finally, I undertook many ad hoc tasks, such as automizing reports with VBA, performing analysis to optimize planograms, and representing Blackhawk at conferences and tradeshows, such as the McKesson Showcase 360°.
					Overall, this work term was a very productive experience, as I was able to experience various aspects of the business world.

					<time>Fall 2017 Courses</time>
					<br><u><b>CS 246</b></u>: <b>Object-Oriented Software Development (UW)</b>; this was probably one of my favourite CS courses thus far; this course taught many useful skills, such as shell
					scripting, C++ development, and Git technology; the assignments were very interesting (usually creating games such as Reversi, and applications such as a photo editor); the final project was
					also very useful in simulating what real-world team-based software development is like
					<br><u><b>STAT 230</b></u>: <b>Probability (UW, Online)</b>; pretty cool course, realy gave me a new perspective on Poker
				    <br><u><b>BUS 127</b></u>: <b>Introduction to Financial Accounting (WLU)</b>; this course focuses on a mix between accounting theory, and accounting practice, in particular the importance of having good form, and using proper notation when
					compiling financial statements
					<br><u><b>BUS 283</b></u>: <b>Financial Management I (WLU)</b>; a mix between financial practice and theory; although the concepts covered were very basic, they did offer an aggregate picture of what finance is
					<br><u><b>BUS 288</b></u>: <b>Organizational Behaviour I (WLU)</b>; a theory-focused course on the human side of business; concepts were not too difficult, but there were a substantial amount of content

					<br><br>
					Much effort of this term was dedicated to career-related development, such as learning to write good résumés. I also spent quite a bit of time studying political science, as well as film studies.

					<br><font size="6">First Internship</font> <br>
					My first internship was as a <b>Corporate Sales Intern</b> at <b>China Merchants Bank</b>. My duties included contacting over 1000 corporate clients (ranging from start-ups, to multi-billion-dollar corporations) through telephone calls and in person.
					I handled all aspects of client-facing situations, ranging from giving margin calls, to preparing and delivering tutorials on new systems and products. I also wrote, edited, and delivered sales pitches for new financial
					products, both in English and Mandarin. I had two main reasons for pursuing an internship in China: I wanted to practice my Mandarin, and I wanted to acclimate myself to the Chinese business environment.
					I felt that, after living many years abroad, despite attending Saturday school, my Mandarin skills have not improved. I wanted to be in an environment which facilitates learning Mandarin, and what better environment than
					being a salesman in China! My proficiency in Mandarin certainly improved during my internship in China. I also wanted to understand the Chinese business world, as China is one of the world's fastest growing economies, and will play a major role in the
					business world for years to come. I learned that the Chinese business world is drastically different than that of the West. Chinese businesspeople emphasize the importance of courtesy (礼), and rely largely on personal connections,
					rather than business connections. There are many rituals and customs which are different from the West, such as gift-giving, and having businesses lunches.

					<br><u><b>CS 136</b></u>: <b>Elementary Algorithm Design and Data Abstraction (UW)</b>; this course is taught in C, which is very appropriate because it is the foundation
					of many modern-day languages, the course also had quite a bit of interesting programming trivia
					<br><u><b>MATH 136</b></u>: <b>Linear Algebra I for Honours Mathematics (UW)</b>; this was the first linear algebra course I've ever taken; I really liked the visual aspects of linear algebra
				    <br><u><b>MATH 138</b></u>: <b>Calculus II for Honours Mathematics (UW)</b>; much alike the first course, the key to doing well is practicing questions until the process becomes mechanical
					<br><u><b>SPCOM 223</b></u>: <b>Public Speaking (UW)</b>; the mandatory communications course required by Waterloo, while I enjoyed the presentations aspect of the course, I found the course readings
						excessive, and very time-consuming
					<br><u><b>BUS 121</b></u>: <b>Functional Areas of the Organization (WLU)</b>; in this course (as well as BUS 111), you roleplay as an entrepreneur with a start-up idea, and you go through
					the different notions of starting a company, including conducting market research, and creating valuation models; my favourite component was probably the pitch to investors
					<br><u><b>ECON 140</b></u>: <b>Introduction to Macroeconomics (WLU)</b>; I found this course very fascinating, and very logical

					<br><br>
					My second semester at university is a trial and error process. I dedicated time to cultivating proper work ethics and discpline. I also started getting more involved in extracurriculars,
					especially case competitions, such as the <b>PRMIA Risk Management Challenge</b>, and being selected to participate in the <b>Undergraduate Mock Trials</b>, hosted by CLAUSE (in which my team broke through the prelims). I also
					started learning actively outside the classroom as well, such as by taking the <b>Building a Financial Model (of a Company)</b> course offered by the Marquee Group.

					<br><u><b>MATH 135</b></u>: <b>Algebra for Honours Mathematics (UW)</b>; this is the "proofs" course; I found the content drastically different from math taught in high school, but more interesting as well
				    <br><u><b>MATH 137</b></u>: <b>Calculus I for Honours Mathematics (UW)</b>; this course is a review of high school calculus, the trick isn't understanding content, but practicing to do questions quickly
					<br><u><b>BUS 111</b></u>: <b>Introduction to Business Organizations (WLU)</b>; very easy course, but very content heavy, and time-consuming
					<br><u><b>ECON 120</b></u>: <b>Introduction to Microeconomics (WLU)</b>; this course really sparked my interest in economics, and the workings of the market

					<br><br>
					Overall, my frist semester at university was very rough. I had a tough time finding a balance in my hectic university schedule, and furthermore, I went into my Computer Science program
					with zero programming experience or knowledge. Despite the proverbial "trial by fire", I felt that I progressed much in this term, not only academically, in picking up programming, but also
					in terms of perspective. I learned to be humble, to have humility, and to not compare one's progress with others'. I participated in few extracurriculars, only attending one or two debate club meetings (both Laurier Debate Society, and
					UW Debate Society) and showing up to a few games of intramural basketball, I chose instead to spend time alone in the gym, or reading philosophy.

					<br><font size="6">First Math Contest</font> <br>
					My first math contest was the Grade 6 Math Kangaroo, for which I placed first in Ottawa, and second nationally. I participated in a couple more math contests after the Kangaroo,
					 such as the Gauss Mathematics Contest, where I placed first for my school. Although my interest in math contests tapered off after middle school, my passion for math remains.

					<br><font size="6">First Job</font> <br>
					I am a strong believer of hard work; I got my first job at age 10, as a newspaper delivery personel for Metroland Media.
					Although being a paperboy required very little skill (inserting flyers into the newspaper, and delivering the paper), and paid very little (around 10¢ per house),
					I am proud to say that I never missed a single delivery, rain (snow) or shine.
					This job has taught me the importance of responsibility, and the significance of money.

					<br><font size="6">Joined Scouts Canada</font> <br>
						I joined the Cub Scouts, and later the Scouts program, as a member of the 1st Nepean Troop. I have always enjoyed being outdoors, partaking in activities such as hiking, canoeing, and camping.
						I have learned many valuable survival skills, and earned many badges along the way. I particularly enjoyed the community involvement aspect of the Scouts program, such as park clean-ups,
						and volunteering in senior homes.

					I believe that a healthy body is a prerequisite for high performance and success. I try to maintain an active and balanced lifestyle through exercising (strength and
					cardiovascular training), as well as intramural sports.

					Music is a lifelong passion of mine; I enjoy all genres of music, ranging from classical to rock, from hip hop to folk.
					I relish in discovering new, niche, genres of music, such as Calypso music from Trinidad and Tobago (check it out!). I have learned to play numerous
					instruments, such as piano, bongo drums, and alto saxophone.
